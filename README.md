# GUSEC Start-Up Funding Portal
This repository contains some part of the code for the project developed for JP Morgan Code for Good hackathon.
The participants of this hackathon were given some problem statements regarding several NGO's and the issues they are facing currently to choose from.     

We have developed this portal for GUSEC organization, a start-up funding company which verifies and helps various new and fresh start-ups all over India, guiding them their way to growth and how to compete in the market.    

This portal provides facility to register and issue verification request upon filling a form. The details are sent to admin, who thoroughly checks the data and found eligible, verifies the start-up and connects with them for further discussion by providing them access to a dashboard portal credentials. This dashboard can be used by the start-up to source funds, i\find investors, customers, request for cheap labour, know market details and much more. Thus, the process of providing overall support to small businesses is eased to a great extent by this portal.     

We have used MERN stack to build this portal. The forms and some webpages are developed using HTML/CSS, and the database is MongoDB.
Here is a short video depicting the overall functional flow of the product:
